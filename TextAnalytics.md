Nice place, great service
Charlotte Motor Speedway, Concord, NC
5/6/2018
The 536 section was an excellent place to watch the race from and you could walk around and experience the V8 majesty from several different places just because you're at the track. The Roval 400 is a treat because you get to see the cars dive into and power out of some excellent corners!
Neat place, even if not on a race day. Things of interest to look at on the track. Food and service at the Speedway Cafe were great.

Parking was abundant around the track and overall it was a treat to be here.
```

Fast lines with poor management
Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, NC
1/22/2022
This stadium is very outdated and lacks amenities common at other stadiums. It is located in the heart of Uptown near Truist Bank and Romere Bearden Park.  The seat numbers are barely visible from being worn down. The menâ€™s bathrooms are poorly lit, have two stalls total, toilets at ankle height, sinks that continuously run, and no heating. Beverage vendors loiter outside bathrooms and block section entrances. Concessions was poorly designed and managed with long lines and menu options being unavailable for 30+ minutes requiring a refund. Security on entry seemed inconsistent with some lines moving very fast and others taking much longer.

Take time to view exhibit
Mint Museum, Charlotte, NC
12/5/2024
If you haven't gone to see Southern Modern,  you owe it to yourself to go. The exhibit will be at the Mint until Feb 2, 2025. 100 paintings from the Mid-Century period when American artists re-shaped the art world. They reflect the time in our country's history full of struggle as well as the personal stories and testaments to humanity's successes and failures. Take time to view the exhibit. Slow view the works. Spend more than 3 minutes looking at a painting. Visually grasp the subtleties and nuances. The information for each work of art was written to help the viewer understand the significance this collection has in society today. Charlotte and the Carolinas is fortunate to have Southern Modern at the Mint Museum.
